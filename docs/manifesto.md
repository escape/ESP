# ESP Manifesto (1‑pager)

**Problem:** The public cannot see who pays to shape their opinions online, how they are targeted, or why content is amplified. Democracy becomes a managed attention market.

**Solution:** Make influence transparent, traceable, auditable.
- Public registries of paid political content.
- Audited logs of algorithmic amplification and targeting.
- Open APIs for researchers and watchdogs.
- Municipal pilots to force early compliance.

**Rule of thumb:** If you can’t see who paid to change your mind, you’re not free.
